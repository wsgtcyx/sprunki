            <h2>How to Play Incredibox Sprunki</h2>
            <p>Creating music in Incredibox Sprunki is an intuitive and enjoyable process. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started on your Sprunki musical journey:</p>
            <div class="steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>1. Choose Your Sprunki Sounds</h3>
                    <p>Browse through the diverse selection of Sprunki beats, effects, melodies, and voices. Each Sprunki sound is represented by a unique icon, making it easy to identify different musical elements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>2. Drag and Drop</h3>
                    <p>Click and drag your chosen sounds onto the characters on screen. Each character represents a different track in your composition. As you drop a sound onto a character, they'll start performing that sound in a loop.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>3. Mix and Match</h3>
                    <p>Experiment with different combinations of sounds. Layer beats, add melodies, throw in some effects, and include vocal elements to create a rich, full composition. Don't be afraid to try unexpected combinations – you might discover something amazing!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>4. Fine-tune Your Mix</h3>
                    <p>Use the volume controls to adjust the balance between different elements of your track. Mute or unmute specific sounds to create breaks or build-ups in your music.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>5. Record and Share</h3>
                    <p>Once you're happy with your creation, use the record function to capture your mix. You can then save it and share it with friends or the wider Incredibox community.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
